## Friends that liked a photo


 1. Open the photo.
 2. Open the popup with the people that liked the photo.
 3. If needed, click `More` button to load all the users.
 4. Then open the browser developer tools where you will run the following script, after including jQuery on page (just paste and run [this code](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js)):
    ```js
    $all = $("div:contains('People Who Like This') ul > li")
    f = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < $all.length; ++i) {
      f.push($("a[data-gt]", $all[i]).text())
    }
    ```



After running the script above, `f` will be an array with the names of the users that liked the opened photo.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
